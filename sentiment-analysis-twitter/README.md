# Sentiment Analysis

This quick sentiment analysis uses Twitter API and TextBlob API in python to produce sentiment output in the form of polarity and subjectivity.

Polarity ranges from [-1, 1] where values towards 1 are positive sentiments whereas those towards -1 are negative sentiments. A polarity of 0 would indicate a neutral sentiment.

Subjectivity ranges between [0, 1] and a subjective sentence may not express any sentiment. On the other hand an objective sentence may. The more subjective a sentence, the value tends towards 1.
